I need a lot more text here in order to test out viewing.

I also need some more paragraphs so that some are out of view, and thus remain unparsed.
Honestly, this file is avery contrived.
It would certainly suffice to just fill it with random characters, but this will be easier to read in test output.

Since the view buffer has five parts to it, we need at least five paragraphs.
But, that five number is already out-of-date.
Or, that's at least the situation as it stands now.
There are also a few random extra lines to see how "empty" paragraphs are handled.

I can't seem to stop writing paragraphs, even though this is just a test file.
Isn't it annoying how each paragraph only has a single sentence in it?
